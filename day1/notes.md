## Day 1

+ We will be using Barretenberg as backend
+ Fields: don't support comparison, they can support arithmatic operations like add and subtraction the reason is they are numbers but withing certain range assume like everything has mod 10^9, so when you say a+ b then it's actually doing (a+b) mod 10^9
+ use number if we require some kind of ordering
